**DESCRIPTION**

- This is a patch mod to try to remove redundancies between Outland and Medieval Overhaul so that the two mods will play nice together.

- Neronix17 did all of the work on the bones patch and offered it up to anyone to try to maintain it back in his 1.3 branch of Outland - Core. So I'm trying to maintain it. We'll see how it goes.
