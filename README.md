**DESCRIPTION**

- This is a patch to remove some redundant buildings and to make Medieval Overhaul and Outland play nice together. Medieval Overhaul bones will be used instead of Outland Bones. There is also support for MO bones to replace Rim of Madness bones if that mod is active.

- Neronix17 did all of the heavy lifting on the bones patch and offered it up to anyone to try to maintain it back in his 1.3 branch of Outland - Core. So I'm trying to maintain it. We'll see how it goes.
